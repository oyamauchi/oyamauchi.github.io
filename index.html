        <p>
          I&rsquo;ve been a software engineer since 2009. I&rsquo;ve worked in a
          wide range of areas, including full-stack development of web, mobile,
          and macOS desktop apps in a variety of domains. I&rsquo;ve also done
          low-level systems work: a just-in-time compiler for PHP and Hack.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&rsquo;m also a technical writer and lecturer. I explain concepts
          clearly and concisely, for both technical and non-technical audiences.
          I&rsquo;ve authored a
          <a

          >
          about the Hack programming language.
